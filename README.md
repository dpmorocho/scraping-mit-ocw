Scraping OCW Courses MIT (JAVA)
==================

Date:   08/07/2014

## About
This is a the version 2 of my test of scraping, now written in Java.

This script gets all OCW link resources of each course available on MIT (http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/) and convert to CSV data. Usage is very simple and code is very well commented!

The CSV file example has the links of each resource (lectures) of each course. Ypu can change the parameters to find other resources in other sections.
